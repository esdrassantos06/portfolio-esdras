Before the refactor link creation and redirects took ~1 second each; after the performance pass creation stabilized at 50-55ms, cache hits redirect in <1ms, and session validation executes in <5 microseconds through a hot local cache. The stack now uses cascading caches (local, Redis, PostgreSQL/Supabase), an optimized pool of 50 Redis connections, prepared statements for every query, and Dockerized services to sustain low latency under heavy traffic."
